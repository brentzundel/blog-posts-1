    A twist on Erskine Gwynne's classic Boulevardier, balancing extra
    rye and campari with a small amount of Cynar 70, a
    stronger-than-expected artichoke liqueur. Paul Clark of Serious
    Eats refers to it as "a Negroni's long lost autumnal cousin."
  instructions: |
    Combine in a shaker half-filled with ice. Shake intensely for
    10-15 seconds, pour into a rocks glass over a large ice cube, top
    with a slice of blood orange.
  flavors:
    - Bitter
    - Herbal
  servings: 2
  proportions:
    - 2 oz. rye (Rittenhouse 100)
    - 2 oz. Campari
    - 1.5 oz. sweet vermouth (Carpano Antica)
    - 0.5 oz. Cynar 70
    - slice of blood orange
  substitutions:
    - 0.5 oz. amaro sfumato, subtract 0.5 oz. vermouth
    - 2 oz. Aperol for Campari, sub 0.5 oz. vermouth, increase Cynar by 0.5 oz

    Based on the original Aviation recipe, but with reduced gin and
    increased lemon and maraschino, to balance the cocktail a little
    bit away from the sometimes overpowering sourness of the original,
    which calls for 2 oz. gin. The creme de violette is genuinely
    important, and gives the cocktail its eye-catching color.
  instructions: |
    Combine in a shaker half-filled with ice. Shake intensely for
    10-15 seconds, serve up in a coupe or martini glass, decorated
    with a lemon peel (preferably flamed).
  flavors:
    - Sweet
    - Herbal
  servings: 1
  proportions:
    - 1.25 oz. gin (dry, juniper-forward)
    - 0.75 oz. lemon juice
    - 0.5 oz. maraschino liqueuer
    - 0.5 oz. creme de violette
    - flamed lemon peel
  substitutions:
    - Subtract 0.25 oz. gin, subtract 0.25 oz. creme de violette to
      match
